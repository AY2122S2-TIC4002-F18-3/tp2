* The project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called _project BUDDY_) used for managing contact details.
  * Project BUDDY is a Teacherâ€™s Contact Management Application supported by CLI text input commands. 
  * Teachers can enter contact information for a swift search and retrieve desired contact information within a few keystrokes. 
  * The application provides an all-in-one display of the contacts related information and their details are presented in a beautiful scrolling view.
* It is named `Project BUDDY` (`BUDDY` for short) because it was initially created as a part of a series of `project BUDDY` projects (`Level 1`, `Level 2`, `Level 3` ...).
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[Project BUDDY](https://ay2122s2-tic4002-f18-3.github.io/tp2/)**.
